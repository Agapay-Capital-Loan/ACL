                    OUR JOURNEY<br>
                </h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: #444;">
                    Agapay Capital Loan started on May 9, 2015, in the historic streets of Intramuros, Manila. Built on the idea of “agapay,” meaning support, we set out to offer more than just loans. We wanted to be a helping hand for individuals and small businesses trying to get ahead. The name also carries the initials of our founders Afable, Cruz, and Licudo, a reminder that this company was born out of shared dreams, hard work, and a deep desire to make a difference.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: #444;">
                    We began at a time when the Philippines was growing fast, and so were the hopes of many Filipinos looking to build something of their own. Over the past 10 years, we’ve stayed true to our values: keep things simple, stay open, and treat every customer with care. As we continue to grow, our mission remains the same. We walk alongside our clients, offering guidance, support, and the financial tools they need to thrive.
                </p>
